Project: A Procedure is Worth a Thousand Pictures

Author: Zoe Cui and Ivy Xu

Note: This code utilizes MediaScheme, a software developed primarily for teaching CSC151 in Grinnell College. If your device does not have MediaScheme, the program will not run. Here is an instruction on how to install it and I have also included several test images.
